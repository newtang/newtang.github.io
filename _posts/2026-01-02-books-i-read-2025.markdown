## Fiction

I didn't get through too many books this year, I'm afraid. Some combination of work, tennis, and too many video games ate into my reading time. I'll try again next year!

#### [![The Way of Kings and Words of Radiance]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2025/wayOfKings.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765376679/)[The Way of Kings](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765376679/) by Brandon Sanderson

I read the first two books of the Stormlight Archive: <em>The Way of Kings</em> and <em>Words of Radiance</em>. This is currently a five book series with more on the way. Anyways, I've heard others claim that this is Sanderson's best series, and I can see why. The books follow several characters, most notably Kaladin, Shallin, Dalinar, and Adolin, in war with a world with a mysterious history, and several factions aiming to gain advantage. This takes place in a setting containing advanced ancient weaponry, and a weakly understood magic system that a handful are able to wield. Really fun, page-turning fiction. Hoping to read more this year!



## Non-fiction

#### [![Revenge of the Tipping Point]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2025/revengeOfTheTippingPoint.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316575801/)[Revenge of the Tipping Point](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316575801/) by Malcolm Gladwell

I enjoy these kind of pop-psych books that Gladwell writes. They're fun to read, and I don't always agree with the conclusions he draws, but there are always some interesting anecdotes and thought provoking stories.

#### [![Order without Design: How Markets Shape Cities]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2025/orderWithoutDesign.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262550970/)[Revenge of the Tipping Point](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262550970/) by Alain Bertaud

The author chatted at Stripe earlier this year and was pretty interesting, so I picked up his book. <em>Order without Design</em> explores the intersection of market economics and urban planning. It's a bit wonkish at times which made it difficult to read casually after a long work day. But, with some downtime around the holiday, I enjoyed spending several hours reading through it. The chapter on housing was particularly compelling.
