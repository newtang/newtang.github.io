The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'm using a modified version of the [Chalk theme](https://github.com/nielsenramon/chalk), and I expect I'll be making various tweaks along the way.

- `jekyll serve --drafts` to show drafts locally
- `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts` also works
- `purifycss css/light.css _site/posts/* --info --out css/purify-light.css` to get rid of unused styles
