Kitchen notes


We recently completed a renovation to our kitchen. It took significantly longer than expected, but we're very happy with the final result. Even though we contracted out the labor, my wife and I were both extremely busy with this project; I joked that it was like taking on a second job. Designing a new kitchen requires an incredible number of decisions, errands, purchases, returns, and research. Now that we've made it through the other side, here's a random smattering of kitchen thoughts. Who doesn't love a good smattering? 

Survival without a kitchen
From what I gather, it sounds like a lot of folks move out of their home or eat out more frequently while construction happens in their kitchen. We managed to setup a temp kitchen which saved us a lot of money. We moved our fridge, cutting board, and some shelving into dining room. We purchased a new microwave (which was going in the new kitchen), found space for our kettle and an induction burner, and we had a very basic kitchen setup. There was no running water, so we had to make trips the bathroom to fill up pots or our kettle. 

Induction stovetop
I'm enjoying our induction range! Switching to induction has been pretty straightforward. It's easy to clean, and our air quality appears to be better. Water boils much faster. Yes, we had to purchase a few new pots and pans, but this was really a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of the entire project. 

Countertop
Our old countertop consisted of square tiles. It was ugly and difficult to clean the grout lines. I wish we had replaced it with something inexpensive we moved ininstead of tolerating it for 9 years. We replaced it with one granite slab. We originally were going to go with quartz, but had a difficult time finding something we liked. Once we found our titanium granite slab, we knew it would fit perfectly, and, we were delighted that it was one of the lower cost slabs. Interestingly, the stone itself was not that expensive, but fabrication is really the hidden cost here. 

Vent hood
It's nice having a legitimate vent hood. Before, our microwave was above our range and it had a weak, useless  fan. 

Dishwasher
The 3rd rack on our Bosch dishwasher is a surprisingly transformative. It's used for utensils and other small, flat items. It opens up a lot of space on the bottom rack for more plates or for pots and pans. I never used to have enough room for a pot in the dishwasher. I've had a couple Bosch dishwashers now, and they've been consistently high quality. 


Undermount sink
A large single basin sink is really nice. We have a "work station sink" which allows for various accessories to be held by the sink. It's a nice idea, but only modestly useful. Having the built in strainer is handy, but we haven't used too many of the other features. Our faucet has a feature for a single forceful high pressure water beam which has been handy for cutting through stubborn grease spots.


Cabinets
Oh boy, I have a lot of thoughts on cabinets. That is not a sentence I thought I would write, but here we are. First a few positives. I definitely recommend under-cabinet lighting, especially if its dimmible. Cabinets and appliances cast a lot of shadows on the, so having an uninterrupted light source for the countertops is very handy. The low dim setting has been useful for leaving some light on for our guests to maneuver around our home after dark.

We have a cabinet with sliding drawers for pots and pans. Again, very handy. I spend a lot less time on the floor hunting around for the pan I need.

I know soft-close cabinet doors are a standard feature now, but it doesn't do anything for me. Maybe I'm just used to mild cabinet slams all the time. However, what I really want is soft _open_. When our cabinet doors are open 90degrees, they'll just fall open all the way, clanging into an adjancent cabninet which I find annoying.

Ok, now for some drama. Do not, under any circumstances, order cabinets from Omega cabinets. It's been nothing short of a disaster. They shipped us chipped, gouged, cracked, and incorrect cabinets repeatedly. We received multiple cabinets that were clearly damaged _and then painted over_. And, the paint was frequently clumpy and the coloring inconsistent. And getting our shitty replacements took 6 weeks each time! Just absolute amateur hour. 

The primary reason we went with semi-custom was to get a 48" blind corner cabinet that we liked, that wasn't available in the more standard options. Honestly, it wasn't worth it. If I were to do it all over again, I was just choose the standard cabinetry available at Lowes, fancy corner be damned. My friends did this, an they also had a broken cabinet shipment, but they were able to get a replacement in a matter of days.


I also wish we had spent a little more time thinking about our soffits and crown moulding. Originally, we had big bulky soffits, and we were hoping they could be reused and trimmed down. Our contractor thought this was reasonable, but it turned out they were constructed from a thick plywood, and became a more complicated roject than originally intended, so they were completely removed. So, new soffits and moulding were sort of an afterthought. They came out ok, but they're probably the weakest part of our kitchen design. 


Aftermath

My old appliances were all functional, but they were a little dated. Our contractor was surprised I wanted to try to sell them; he didn't think there would be much of a market for them. His other clients usually discard their old appliances along with the other demolition debris. Well, he was wrong; I managed to sell all my old appliances through Facebook marketplace. Getting the few extra hundred bucks was nice, but the main reason I wanted to sell was simply because I don't like to discard usable, functional items. It felt wasteful. Everyone I sold to seemed to have a genuine need for the appliance. They saved a few bucks from having to buy something new, and I wasted a little less. 

Also, I'd suggest looking for rebates if you're moving any appliances from gas to electric. I got $250 for transitioning from a gas to induction stove from [https://www.bayren.org/](Bayren).

- sell gas ones?

Non tile countertop. Wish I did a countertop earlier.
I love our granite countertop. Turns out, cheaper than you might think.

Have to make a zillion decisions.

Grout color makes a big difference.

Recess is useful.
