Played a lot of Hades which [I covered in last year's post](/posts/video-games-2020). 


<h4 style="margin:0;">Gone Home</h4>
*PC*<br/>

After traveling abroad for awhile, your character returns home to a mysteriously vacant and creepy house. No parents, no sister. As you go through the house you assemble clues as to the whereabouts of your family. Don't worry; no jump scares or anything. This is a relatively short first-person perspective game; I got through it in around 2 hours. It's not particularly challenging, but it's not really supposed to be. It's more of an immersive, interactive story with a compelling narrative. I enjoyed it. 

<h4 style="margin:0;">Castle Crashers Remastered</h4>
*Switch*<br/>

I played this game over a decade ago, but now it's remastered and on modern consoles. It's a fun co-op beat-em-up slasher, kind of like old arcade games like X-Men or Ninja Turtles. It turns out the remastered version is still fun and a little easier on the eyes. The damsels in distress theme is badly dated and a little cringey at this point, but it doesn't really impact the gameplay much. Still fun, go play with a friend!


<h4 style="margin:0;">Stephen's Sausage Roll</h4>

Somehow, a game that involves solving puzzles by rolling and pushing sausages onto grill-like tiles so they're evenly cooked on both sides manages to be very challenging and satifying. I don't particularly care for the visual style, but this is an excellent puzzler. It would make a fantastic Switch game, but I don't think there are any plans to port it over. 


<h4 style="margin:0;">Terraria</h4>
*PC*<br/>

I did not think I would enjoy this as much as I have been. This is sort of like a 2D Minecraft. I've been regularly playing with friends who recently moved away as a way to keep in touch. I thought I'd be bored because there didn't seem to be much direction. But, there's a ton to discover, fun quests, fun item upgrades, and plenty of monsters. Not to mention, given all the materials that are in this world, there's a lot of very fun artistic structures that can be made. This game has been challenging, funny, and delightful, and has been a lot of fun to play with friends. Not sure it would be as enjoyable single player.


<h4 style="margin:0;">Ori and the Will of the Wisps</h4>
*Switch*<br/>

This is a sequel to the excellent [Ori and the Blind Forest which I played 5 years ago](/posts/video-games-2016). Needless to say, the Will of the Wisps is a worthy successor. It's just as beautiful (if not moreso) and vibrant and fun as the original. There are a couple changes to how you upgrade Ori's abilities, which to be honest I don't really like, but in the end it's a minor quibble for a gorgeous game.
