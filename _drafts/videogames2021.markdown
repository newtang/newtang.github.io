After traveling abroad for awhile, your character returns home to a mysteriously vacant and creepy house. No parents, no sister. As you go through the house you assemble clues as to the whereabouts of your family. Don't worry; no jump scares or anything. This is a relatively short first-person perspective game; I got through it in around 2 hours. It's not particularly challenging, but it's not really supposed to be. It's more of an immersive, interactive story with a compelling narrative. I enjoyed it. 

<h4 style="margin:0;">Castle Crashers Remastered</h4>
*Switch*<br/>

I played this game over a decade ago, but now it's remastered and on modern systems. It's a fun co-op beat-em-up slasher, kind of like old arcade games like X-Men or Ninja Turtles. It turns out the remastered version is still fun and a little easier on the eyes. The damsels in distress theme is badly dated and a little cringey at this point, but it doesn't really impact the gameplay much. Still fun, go play with a friend!
