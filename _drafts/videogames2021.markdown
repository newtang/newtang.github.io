Played a lot of Hades which [I covered in last year's post](/posts/video-games-2020).

After traveling abroad for awhile, your character returns home to a mysteriously vacant and creepy house. No parents, no sister. As you go through the house you assemble clues as to the whereabouts of your family. Don't worry; no jump scares or anything. This is a relatively short first-person perspective game; I got through it in around 2 hours. It's not particularly challenging, but it's not really supposed to be. It's more of an immersive, interactive story with a compelling narrative. I enjoyed it.
