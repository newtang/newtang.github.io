Obduction
I really, really wanted to like Obduction. It's made by the creators of Myst which I had played a long time ago as a teenager. It's beautiful, it's haunting, and, well, it's a bit slow, and I just couldn't get into it. I don't know if it's because I don't have the patience to gut through some of the slower or confusing parts. Maybe I was just excited to try my hand at other games that were on the horizon. But, for whatever reason I just wasn't captivated by this game. Maybe, I'll try to revisit it someday.

Armikrog
This is a quick, fun whimisical game. I love the usage of stop motion. Puzzles aren't particularly challenging, except maybe one or two. Game isn't very long. But it's fun.

Stardew Valley
I've never played a game quite like this. I'm told it's like Harvest Moon. It's like being in a town in Zelda, but the townspeople are more developed and there's far more quests. There's lots of ways to make money, and lots of things to do like farming, raising livestock, fishing, mining, doing quests, fighting monsters, talking to townspeople, etc. I was surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did. Impressively it's made by a single indie developer.
