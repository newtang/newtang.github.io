## Fiction

#### [![The Way of Kings]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2025/wayOfKings.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765376679/)[The Way of Kings](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765376679/) by Brandon Sanderson

This is the first book of the Stormlight Archive; I believe this is currently a five book series with more on the way. Anyways, I've heard others claim that this is Sanderson's best series, and I can see why. The book follows several characters, most notably Kaladin, in war with a world with a mysterious history, and several factions aiming to gain advantage. All in a setting containing advanced ancient weaponry, and a weakly understood magic system that a handful are able to wield. Terrific book. Hoping to read more this year!
