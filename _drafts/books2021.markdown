## Non-fiction

#### [![All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood ]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2021/allJoyNoFun.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L9E1R66)[All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L9E1R66) by Jennifer Senior
While most books of the parenting genre discuss the  impacts of parents' decisions on kids this book looks at the impacts of kids on their parents. Senior deftly combines research and real world stories to discuss how parenting, particularly in America, has changed over the years. Surprisingly compelling read. 

#### [![Color of Law]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2021/allJoyNoFun.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M8IWJT2)[Color of Law](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M8IWJT2) by Richard Rothstein 
An important book for any YIMBY, or anyone curious about why their home is zoned the way it is. Rothstein's incredibly well-researched book painstakingly goes through the largely racist history of our zoning laws in different parts of the country.  

#### [![Talking to Strangers]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2021/talkingToStrangers.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NDKVWZW)[Talking to Strangers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NDKVWZW) by Malcolm Gladwell
This is full of fascinating and troubling stories that illustrate the consequences of our inability to communicate well with strangers. I really enjoy Gladwell's approachable writing style and how he manages to reiterate his questions without being overly repetitive.
