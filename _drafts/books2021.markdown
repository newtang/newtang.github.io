#### [![All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood ]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2021/allJoyNoFun.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L9E1R66)[All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L9E1R66) by Jennifer Senior
While most books of the parenting genre discuss the  impacts of parents' decisions on kids this book looks at the impacts of kids on their parents. Senior deftly combines research and real world stories to discuss how parenting, particularly in America, has changed over the years. Surprisingly compelling read.
