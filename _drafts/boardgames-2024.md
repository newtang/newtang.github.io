#### [![Rising Sun]({{ site.url }}/assets/boardgames-2024/risingSun.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px;"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076PDV9KR/)[Wingspan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076PDV9KR/)

I was a little intimidated by Rising Sun when we started to go through it. It's a hug box, with a ton of intricate, beautiful pieces and it felt like there were a zillion rules and options. But, as we got going through the first season, I was able to settle in and follow along for a pretty satisfying gaming experience. Each player controls a clan in Feudal Japan with unique abilities and attempts to occupy and defend multiple provinces. Players can ally with each other, but also betray each other. There are several ways of gaining victory points, but winning wars is probably the most consequential. The war phase is a fun mechanic; there's a bit of bluffing as each player makes hidden bets for how much resources they gamble on various components of the war. Fun, well designed game!
