I was a little intimidated by Rising Sun when we started to go through it. It's a hug box, with a ton of intricate, beautiful pieces and it felt like there were a zillion rules and options. But, as we got going through the first season, I was able to settle in and follow along for a pretty satisfying gaming experience. Each player controls a clan in Feudal Japan with unique abilities and attempts to occupy and defend multiple provinces. Players can ally with each other, but also betray each other. There are several ways of gaining victory points, but winning wars is probably the most consequential. The war phase is a fun mechanic; there's a bit of bluffing as each player makes hidden bets for how much resources they gamble on various components of the war. Fun, well designed game!

This is a small, cooperative card game where each person has a set of tunnels, and the group is trying to make sure the prisoner cannot escape by ending or connecting each tunnel. We played a couple times and we were disappointed by how easy this was. Meh.

An interesting, competitive card game. There's a thin story veneer where each player runs a rival circus, and tries to either put on the best act or scout another circus' performer. It's not really that important to how the game works. Each player has a hand of cards, and each card has different numbers at thet top and bottom, and the order of the hand cannot change except at the beginning of play. Players try to put down straights or matching combinations, while other attempt to beat it or take (scout) cards. It's a pretty fun mechanic!
