## Fiction

#### [![Warbreaker]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2024/warbreaker.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KYHZHA/)[Warbreaker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KYHZHA/) by Brandon Sanderson

Another fun Sanderson read. He's very adept at crafting magic systems and mixing them with his environment. Warbreaker follows the adventures of sisters Vivenna and Siri as they're hurtled into a new culture and attempt to prevent war on their own people. Along the way they learn about the magic from BioChroma, and a world of gods. 


#### [![The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2024/theLongWayToASmallAngryPlanet.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZP64F28/)[The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZP64F28/) by Becky Chambers

I loved this deep future sci-fi. Chambers does a fantastic job imagining and documenting the different cultures of multiple intelligent species, and the awkward difficulties of intermingling. This adventure follows Rosemary as she joins the crew of the Wayfarer, an aging interplanetary ship that tunnels wormholes. Great characters and a compelling storyline. The first in a series.
