## Fiction

#### [![Warbreaker]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2024/warbreaker.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KYHZHA/)[Warbreaker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KYHZHA/) by Brandon Sanderson

Another fun Sanderson read. He's very adept at crafting magic systems and mixing them with his environment. Warbreaker follows the adventures of sisters Vivenna and Siri as they're hurtled into a new culture and attempt to prevent war on their own people. Along the way they learn about the magic from BioChroma, and a world of gods. 


#### [![The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2024/theLongWayToASmallAngryPlanet.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZP64F28/)[The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZP64F28/) by Becky Chambers

I loved this deep future sci-fi. Chambers does a fantastic job imagining and documenting the different cultures of multiple intelligent species, and the awkward difficulties of intermingling. This adventure follows Rosemary as she joins the crew of the Wayfarer, an aging interplanetary ship that tunnels wormholes. Great characters and a compelling storyline. The first in a series.




## Non-fiction

#### [![Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2024/code.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0137909101/)[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0137909101/) by Charles Petzold

I don't remember how this book got on my radar, but I really enjoyed about the first third of this book. It covered the history of communication and how certain "codes" work like Braille, Morse Code, and even QR codes. Then it got into the meat of the content: logic gates, telegraphs, and basic circuitry, which was excellent. As the book progressed into more complex circuitry, I personally found it more difficult to follow as a casual reader.  


#### [![Build, Baby, Build: The Science and Ethics of Housing Regulation]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2024/build.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1952223415/)[Build, Baby, Build: The Science and Ethics of Housing Regulation](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1952223415/) by Bryan Caplan 

Economist Bryan Caplan teams up illustrator Ady Branzei in this graphic novel to make the case for more housing. 
As someone who's been in the pro-housing movement for years, I didn't find anything too surprising in this book. But, it was still an enjoyable read, and I appreciated the effort to give perspectives from different political and philosophical view points. I think this is a great book for those how are curious about housing crisis, and interested in the pro-housing movement.  


#### [![A City on Mars: Can we settle space, should we settle space, and have we really thought this through?]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2024/aCityOnMars.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984881728/)[A City on Mars](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984881728/) by Kelly and Zach Weinersmith

A really in depth look at the challenges that need to be tackled in order to build a sustainable city on Mars. The book covers everything from pregnancy to political challenges, mixed with trademark Weinersmith (author and cartoonist of Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal) humor. Somewhat surprisingly, the book is actually pretty pessimistic, about settling Mars in the near term. But, it's clear from their exhaustive research, that that appears to be the only sensible conclusion. A fantastic education, and hilarious read!
