#### [![The Anatomy of the Swipe: Making Money Move]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2022/anatomyOfTheSwipe.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1641374470/)[The Anatomy of the Swipe: Making Money Move](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1641374470/) by Ahmed Siddiqui
I thought it'd be handy to get some additional insight into our financial system for [my job](https://stripe.com), and this book dips into some of the inner workings. It touches upon several different areas, but unfortunately doesn't get too deep into the weeds. A relatively easy read.

#### [![Walkable City]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2022/walkableCity.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0865477728/)[Walkable City](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0865477728/) by Jeff Speck
Probably the best book on urbanism and what to consider when planning a city that's car light.
