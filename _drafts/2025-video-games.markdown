I did not have a video games post in 2024! When I did game, it was mostly Tears of the Kingdom, Baldur's Gate, and NYT Games, all of which I wrote about in my 2023 post.

*Switch*<br/>

Chants of Senaar is a single player game where the player has to solve puzzles and translate the  languages of the different groups living in the tower. There are clues scattered throughout. The bold, cell-shaded graphical style is really unique.

<h4 style="margin:0;">Inscryption</h4>
*PC*<br/>

Inscryption is a kind of a bizarre rogue-like card game, where the player is in captivity playing for their life. The room can be explored and can affect game play.
