Types of Board Games and Board game mechanics


Drafting
- Players pick from a set of options, usually cards, and remaining players pick from what's left

Stated Examples:
- 7 Wonders, Sushi Go

Azul has a drafting element



Area Control
- Players need to own or control area of a map
Examples: Risk, Small World

Legacy
Game elements change based on decisions and events, so subsequent play throughs are altered. Usually with a story element behind it.

Deckbuilders
Start with a simple deck, and build a more powerful one as the game progresses. However deck construction games, like Magic are different. In deck construction, the deck is built outside of the game via trading cards or purchasing cards. Deck building is an in-game element of Deckbuilders

Examples: Dominion

Dungeon Crawler
Make your way through a map, defeating enemies

Engine Builder
Build an engine with starting resources, that provides ever increasing resources, and eventually some form of victory points.
