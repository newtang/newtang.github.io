Wingspan is a beautiful, competitive game where players are trying to collect birds for their aviary. The birds provide the player with various bonuses that allow for extra points. It's a little tricky to learn at first; there are a couple unusual mechanics and there are a lot of strategies to win. But, after a few rounds it's easier to get the hang of it. Also, this is probably one of the highest quality games I've played. The art is excellent, there's a ton of factoids about birds, and even the manuals use a high grade paper stock.
