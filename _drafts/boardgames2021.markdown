I wish I got to play this a little bit more, but there's some solid strategy in this dice-rolling odds based strategy game. Each player controls a monster, and can choose whether to stay on the defensive or attack other players.  

#### [![Trial by Trolley]({{ site.url }}/assets/boardgames-2021/trialByTrolley.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px;"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X5DV7T9/)[Trial by Trolley](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X5DV7T9/)
This is a fun adult party game for people who like to argue about nonsense. The premise is based on the [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem), and each team places cards on one of two tracks, and the conductor, who rotates every game has to decide which track to "kill". The two teams try to argue and convince the conductor who should remain. Fun!

#### [![Overrated]({{ site.url }}/assets/boardgames-2021/overrated.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px;"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083JKXTYG/)[Overrated](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083JKXTYG/)
A Cards Against Humanity-like party game where people play review cards from their hand, for a particular venue or place, and the judge chooses their favorite. I was pretty skeptical at first, but there are some pretty funny reviews.

I did touch on this on [last year's board game post](/posts/boardgames-2020), but it took up a big chunk of my game playing time this year. It is a lot of fun to play with a regular friend group, and the mechanics and the story evolve over time. However, a lot stays the same, so you have to enjoy playing Pandemic repeatedly to appreciate this game.
