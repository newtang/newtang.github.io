Since mass-vaccination, I've been able to game with some pals! Here's a few.

The spirtual successor to Agricola, players in Caverna each maintain their own greenspace for farming and caves for mining. Players can branch into a number of different strategies, like grow a family, undertake expeditions, and add dwellings to your cave, each of which has their own benefits and drawbacks. It's kind of a board game version of Age of Empires or Stardew Valley to some extent. It takes a few rounds to get the hang of it, but it's pretty fun. Unfortunately, the game goes on a bit too long. In our 5 person game, we were unable to complete it after several hours of play.
