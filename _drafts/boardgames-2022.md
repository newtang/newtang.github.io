Since mass-vaccination, I've been able to game with some pals! Here's a few.

#### [![Caverna]({{ site.url }}/assets/boardgames-2022/caverna.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px;"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G3FV2TO)[Caverna](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G3FV2TO)
The spirtual successor to Agricola, players in Caverna each maintain their own greenspace for farming and caves for mining. Players can branch into a number of different strategies, like grow a family, undertake expeditions, and add dwellings to your cave, each of which has their own benefits and drawbacks. It's kind of a board game version of Age of Empires or Stardew Valley to some extent. It takes a few rounds to get the hang of it, but it's pretty fun. Unfortunately, the game goes on a bit too long. In our 5 person game, we were unable to complete it after several hours of play.

#### [![Parks]({{ site.url }}/assets/boardgames-2022/parks.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px;"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SVNZXY4)[Parks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SVNZXY4)
Fun game where you "visit" parks and do different activities. Sort of like Tokaido in that each player is moving along a path, and path spaces can't usually be shared. Some solid strategy involved, but not overly complex. The game contains beautiful artwork and factoids about our National Parks!


#### [![Herbaceous Sprouts]({{ site.url }}/assets/boardgames-2022/herbaceousSprouts.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px;"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JG24C3F)[Herbaceous Sprouts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JG24C3F)
This is a kind of re-imagining of [Herbaceous, fun card game I reviewed 5 years ago](/posts/boardgames-2017). It keeps similar elements of the original like the different ways of forming various collections. But, it manages to make it a little more complicated, and the lovely original artwork is shrunk to appear on small tokens which aren't as nice and occasionally difficult to decipher. I don't think this game is an improvement over the original.

#### [![Steampunk Rally]({{ site.url }}/assets/boardgames-2022/steampunkRally.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px;"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0992126819)[Steampunk Rally](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0992126819)
Each player constructs a vehicle from different cards they collect, which can be powered with different colored dice. The amount of energy generated is based on dice rolls, which can indicate how far you travel on the race track. Kind of a tricky game to understand at first, but once you get going, it's really fun. The end-game scenario seemed like they needed some work; a couple players in my game awkwardly went well beyond the final possible landing square. Besides that, we had a great time with this game!
