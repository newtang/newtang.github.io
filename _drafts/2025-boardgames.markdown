An interesting worker placement game where your workers farm the fields, do all the tasks necessary to produce and sell wine. I played the first time with 4 experienced players, and I had no idea what I was doing. By the end of the game, I finally caught on to the rules and some strategy. Oh well! It's a little hard to follow at first, but once you get a few rotations in, it becomes a little clearer how to play. Fun, but a little complex.

Ito is a cooperative party game where a category is drawn, and each player draws a number between 1-100. Players collectively attempt to sort their numbers based on where it would fall in the category. So, if the category is "size of an animal", where 0 is smallest, players have to specify which animal corresponds to their number, and sort the numbers. It's fun! You get into some interesting conversations about the categories and why people chose what they did.
