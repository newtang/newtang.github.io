Calculus notes


A long time ago, I used to be pretty good at math, but my advancement mostly stopped at Calculus AB. Sure, after that I took some discrete math, and statistics. I also took some logic, automata, and machine learning courses that Coursera provided.

I was curious what the next steps were beyond what I had learned in calculus. I don't think I have a particular use for them, but I was interested in series, and differential equations even though I only had the faintest idea of what they were.

I remember my high school calculus surprisingly well. I'm not entirely sure why it stuck; when so many other things that I've learned since then have been forgotton. I remembered limits, power rule for determining integrals, and integrals, surprisingly well. But, I decided to spend the first few days in review anyways.

I went over derivitives and the power rule, and it all felt familiar.

d/dx 2x^3 + x^2 + 3x + 5  ->  6x^2 + 2x + 3

I didn't remember the chain rule, but I must've learned it.It was pretty straightforward to relearn.
