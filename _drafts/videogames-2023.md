I don't actually remember how this game got on my radar, but I'm glad it did. This is a 2D puzzle exploration world, sort of like a 2D version of The Witness. Anyways, there's some clever puzzles and the music adds a chill, relaxing vibe. I got through hundreds of puzzles, of varying difficulty. Great game!

I don't know what else can be written about Zelda that hasn't already been said. Incredible game, a worthwhile sequel to Breath of the Wild. This is a big reason my video games list is a little lacking this year, and likely a reason it'll be lacking next year. Big, beautiful world, with tons of quests, and the building mechanic is a lot of fun to play with.

Me, my wife, and a couple friends have had a weekly cadence of playing Baldur's Gate together, and we've been steadily working our way through the story. The game is essentially a highly detailed campaign in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. It's not critical to know about D&D, but it's helpful to get acclimated. Anyways, we've had an absolute blast. The writing is really fun, turn-based combat is not overly stressful, and the world is beautiful. There's plenty to explore, and the game has a lot of fun surprises. Even though we're not close to finishing it, I'm actually looking forward to playing it again with another character, making different decisions.
