I don't actually remember how this game got on my radar, but I'm glad it did. This is a 2D puzzle exploration world. It's sort of like a 2D version of The Witness. Anyways, there's some clever puzzles and the music add a chill, relaxing vibe. I got through hundreds of puzzles, of varying difficulty. Great game!
