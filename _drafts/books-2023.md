#### [![Bossypants]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2023/bossypants.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011MEKLXS/)[Bossypants](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011MEKLXS/) by Tina Fey
Tina Fey is just one of those people who really makes me laugh. I enjoyed her work on 30 Rock and her autobiography doesn't disappoint. In addition to the jokes, it provides interesting background around other notable parts of her life, like joining SNL and impersonating Sarah Palin. The book is a little dated at this point, just over 10 years old, but I still really enjoyed it. 

#### [![Payments Systems in the US]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2023/paymentsSystemsUS.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982789742/)[Payments Systems in the US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982789742/) by Carol Coye Benson, Scott Loftesness, Russ Jones
Last year I read [Anatomy of the Swipe]({{site.url}}/posts/books-i-read-2022), and I found it rather lacking. However, Payments Systems in the US manages to provide a lot more detail and breadth into more payments systems, including their history, and how recent legislation affects the various payment methods. This was really well written, and a good primer for anyone diving into the financial industry. 

#### [![Open: An Autobiography]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2023/open.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307388409/)[Open: An Autobiography](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307388409/) by Andre Agassi
This was probably one of the most compelling biographies I have ever read. Agassi chronicles his difficult and bizarre childhood, as well as his Grand Slam triumphs, and relationships. This is another slightly dated autobiography (around 10 years old), but it's an entertaining glimpse into one of the last great American tennis champions.
