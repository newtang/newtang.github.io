#### [![Bossypants]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2023/bossypants.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011MEKLXS/)[Bossypants](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011MEKLXS/) by Tina Fey
Tina Fey is just one of those people who really makes me laugh. I enjoyed her work on 30 Rock and her autobiography doesn't disappoint. In addition to the jokes, it provides interesting background around other notable parts of her life, like joining SNL and impersonating Sarah Palin. The book is a little dated at this point, just over 10 years old, but I still really enjoyed it.
