## Fiction



#### [![The Mistborn Saga - the Wax & Wayne Series]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2023/alloyOfLaw.webp){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QOTLDJ8/)[The Mistborn Saga - the Wax & Wayne Series](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QOTLDJ8/) by Brandon Sanderson

A few years ago I read the [first Mistborn trilogy](/posts/books-i-read-2020) per my nieces' recommendations. I finally got around to reading the follow up trilogy which consists of The Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, and the Bands of Mourning. It takes place centuries after the original trilogy, in a pseudo-western/industrial age and most of the main characters are part of world's religion or lore. It's been pretty fun to see how allomancy and feruchemy and other fantasy bits get put to use in this universe. Fun characters, easy read, and again, some solid surprises. A worthwhile follow up!



## Non-fiction

#### [![Bossypants]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2023/bossypants.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011MEKLXS/)[Bossypants](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011MEKLXS/) by Tina Fey
Tina Fey is just one of those people who really makes me laugh. I enjoyed her work on 30 Rock and her autobiography doesn't disappoint. In addition to the jokes, it provides interesting background around other notable parts of her life, like joining SNL and impersonating Sarah Palin. The book is a little dated at this point, just over 10 years old, but I still really enjoyed it. 

#### [![Payments Systems in the US]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2023/paymentsSystemsUS.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982789742/)[Payments Systems in the US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982789742/) by Carol Coye Benson, Scott Loftesness, Russ Jones
Last year I read [Anatomy of the Swipe]({{site.url}}/posts/books-i-read-2022), and I found it rather lacking. However, Payments Systems in the US manages to provide a lot more detail and breadth into more payments systems, including their history, and how recent legislation affects the various payment methods. This was really well written, and a good primer for anyone diving into the financial industry. 

#### [![Open: An Autobiography]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2023/open.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307388409/)[Open: An Autobiography](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307388409/) by Andre Agassi
This was probably one of the most compelling biographies I have ever read. Agassi chronicles his difficult and bizarre childhood, as well as his Grand Slam triumphs, and relationships. This is another slightly dated autobiography (around 10 years old), but it's an entertaining glimpse into one of the last great American tennis champions.

#### [![What We Owe the Future]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2023/whatWeOweTheFuture.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N3D7QSQ)[What We Owe the Future](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N3D7QSQ) by William MacAskill
I was excited about this book, but unfortunately, [as my friend Jonathan warned me, it falls a little flat](https://twitter.com/jpalardy/status/1608260925559308288?s=20). There's a few interesting tidbits, but overall it feels too big for the point it tries to make. I did enjoy the end where it discusses how to make the biggest impacts in our life.
